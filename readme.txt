Abstract:
In an era where most video games revolve around guns, violence, and death, card games are a good alternative. Out of these is BlackJack, arguably the best game for those new to card games. BlackJack has a simple aim (get 21), simple rules, and is fast paced and exciting. Hence, I decided to create a Blackjack program, creatively titled BlackJack. This program is designed for only one player; the dealer is an AI. This program allows players grasp the game, and even allows for more complex strategies like card counting.
